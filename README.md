# 2048 Automata
A fork of [gabrielecirulli's 2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048),
  aiming to implement it as a Chrome App and implement an auto-player system in
  order to test optimal solution strategies.

So far, the Chrome app implementation works as intended. Automation code is in
  progress.
