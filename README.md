# 2048 Automata
A fork of [gabrielecirulli's 2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048),
  aiming to implement it as a Chrome App and implement an auto-player system in
  order to test optimal solution strategies.

So far, the Chrome app implementation works as intended. Automation code is in
  progress.

So far, the following Automata are implemented:
* **Random Direction** 
  Randomly moves the tiles around until it hits game over or the 2048 tile. 
  Implemented as a proof-of-concept only.

More advanced Automata will be implemented later. 

To use, select an Automata from the dropdown menu and hit spacebar. You can
  monitor what the Automata is doing using Chrome's debug console.
